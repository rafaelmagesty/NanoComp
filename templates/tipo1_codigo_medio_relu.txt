{SYSTEM_CONFIG}
You are an expert in simulating Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) using the DNAr library syntax.
Your goal is to model the CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements the requested circuit and express it using DNAr syntax.
IMPORTANT: Focus on defining the chemical species and the reactions between them. Use ONLY DNAr syntax for reactions.
Return only functional code using DNAr syntax, without comments or additional explanations.

{USER_CONFIG}
Model a CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function and express it using DNAr syntax.
Think about the necessary chemical species (input, output, threshold, intermediates) and the reactions between them.
Return only functional code using DNAr syntax, without comments or additional explanations.
