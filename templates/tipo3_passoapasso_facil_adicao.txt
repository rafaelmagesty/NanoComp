{SYSTEM_CONFIG}
You are an expert in simulating Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) using the DNAr library syntax.
Your goal is to model the CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements the requested circuit and express it using DNAr syntax.
IMPORTANT: Focus on defining the chemical species and the reactions between them. Use ONLY DNAr syntax for reactions.
Return only functional code using DNAr syntax, without comments or additional explanations.

Model a CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements an addition operation and express it using DNAr syntax. Follow these steps:
- Load the DNAr, ggplot2 and dplyr libraries.
- Define initial concentrations of inputs (InputA and InputB).
- Set up species: define the chemical species involved in the CRN (inputs, output, intermediate products if necessary, Waste).
- Configure reactions: define the CHEMICAL REACTIONS that implement addition (DNAr syntax: "A + B -> C").
- Define initial concentrations (ci) for all species.
- Adjust reaction constants (ki) and simulation time (t).
- Execute react(species, ci, reactions, ki, t).
- Plot with plot_behavior(behavior, species = c("InputA", "InputB", "Output")).

You must return only the R code with the following format:

library(DNAr)  # Loading the library
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
InputA <- 3
InputB <- 2
InputF <- 20
ID <- 0
concentracoesIniciais <- c(InputA, InputB, 0, 0)
especies <- c('A','B','C','Waste')
reacoes <- c('A -> A + C', 
             'B -> B + C',
             'C -> Waste'
            )
# Simulating
b <- react(
  species = especies,
  ci = concentracoesIniciais,
  reactions = reacoes,
  ki = rep(2.8e-3, 3),
  t = seq(0, 1.6e3, length.out = 50)
)
# Rescaling seconds -> hours
b <- b %>%
  mutate(time = time / 3600)
# Plot
p <- plot_behavior(
  b,
  x_label     = 'Time (h)',
  y_label     = 'Concentration (nmol/L)',
  legend_name = 'Species',
  geom_list   = c('line', 'point'),
  species = c('A','B','C')
)
cat('Behaviour:\n')
print(b)
print(p)
