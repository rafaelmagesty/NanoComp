{SYSTEM_CONFIG}
You are an expert in simulating Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) using the DNAr library syntax.
Your goal is to model the CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements the requested circuit and express it using DNAr syntax.
IMPORTANT: Focus on defining the chemical species and the reactions between them. Use ONLY DNAr syntax for reactions.
Return only functional code using DNAr syntax, without comments or additional explanations.

Model a CRN (chemical reaction network) that implements a sigmoid activation function and express it using DNAr syntax. Follow these steps:
- Load the DNAr, ggplot2 and dplyr libraries.
- Define initial concentration of input.
- Set up species: define the chemical species involved in the sigmoid CRN (Input, intermediates for curve approximation, Output, Waste).
- Configure reactions: define the CHEMICAL REACTIONS that approximate sigmoid behavior. Use DNAr syntax.
- Define initial concentrations (ci) for all species.
- Adjust reaction constants (ki) and simulation time (t).
- Execute react(species, ci, reactions, ki, t).
- Plot with plot_behavior(behavior, species = c("Input", "Output")).
